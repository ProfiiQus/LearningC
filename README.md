# LearningC

Repository, containing various projects, structures, functions and programs that I used when studying software development in `C` language. Each of the utility classes was written at different times, hence some code may differ in naming conventions, usings etc.

## Current code snippets:

- [Array of custom structures](/array_of_structs/)
- [Date utility functions](/date)
- [String implementation](/string)
